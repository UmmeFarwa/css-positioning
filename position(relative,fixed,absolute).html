        <!--<img src="./image/m.png" alt="" />-->

        <p>The NED University of Engineering & Technology, was established in March 1977 under
            an act of the Provincial Assembly of Sindh after upgrading of the former NED Government
            Engineering College, which was set up in 1921. The NED University is thus one of the oldest
            institution in Pakistan for teaching and producing Engineering graduates. Prior to this,
            the D.J.Sindh College , used to run classes to train subordinates for the Sindh P.W.D.,
            the Municipalities and Local Boards.</p>

                is Pakistanâ€™s flagship engineering institution which shall soon be celebrating its
                centenary. The university is known for producing high quality graduates and for its
